# Question Answering with BERT

This is a question answering project using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture from the transformers library. This project allows users to input a context or passage and ask specific questions on that context. The model will then provide the answer to the question by analyzing the provided context.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher

- PyTorch

- Transformers

- Streamlit

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/bhavinpatil/Question-Answering-System.git

Navigate to the project directory using the command:

    cd question-answering-bert

Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

    streamlit run code_1.py


This will open the app in a new browser window. You will see two text boxes, one for the context or passage and one for the question you want to ask.

Enter the context or passage in the first text box.

Enter your question in the second text box.

Click the "Answer" button.

The answer to your question will be displayed on the screen.
